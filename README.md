# Spending Alarm

Chris Greenhalgh, The University of Nottingham, 2019

A Databox driver based on a mental health early warning signs
application, which monitors bank transactions (from the TrueLayer
driver), applies a configurable check, and reports an alarm
to a remote monitoring service (provisionally based on 
[RADAR-BASE](https://radar-base.org/).

Status: just starting.
